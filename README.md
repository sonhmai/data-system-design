## Basics

- What is ACID?
    - Atomicity: A transaction should either complete successfully or just fail. There should not be any partial success.
    - Consistency: A transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another state.
    - Isolation: Every transaction should be independent of each other i.e., one transaction should not affect another.
    - Durability: If a transaction is completed, it should be preserved in the database even if the machine state is lost or a system failure might occur.

- Why need ACID on the data lake?
